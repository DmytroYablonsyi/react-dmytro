            The opening line in all Star Wars films is "A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...". The saga tells about the life of various civilizations and factions of this galaxy, among which there are both humans and various other thinking beings, highly developed and primitive, numerous fantastic animals and plants. The story spans thousands of years from ancient times to the "present" time, depicted primarily in movies. Most of the galaxy has at various times been controlled by a state: the Galactic Republic, the Galactic Empire, the New Republic, or the Supreme Order. These states covered or cover thousands of planets with different populations and levels of development. The most numerous species in the galaxy are humans, who, like on Earth, differ in facial features and skin color. Human language is the basis for the main galactic language. For the convenience of the story, the main galactic human language is given in English in the original, and in the translated language in the translations of the films into other languages. For example, in the Ukrainian translation of the Saga, the main galactic language, the human language, is rendered in Ukrainian.The galaxy is divided, depending on the structure and meaning, into regions. Those, in turn, are divided into sectors, planetary systems and individual planets. The main regions are the Core, Core Colonies, Inner Ring, Expansion Region, Middle Ring, Outer Ring, Tingel Sleeve, Wild Space, and Unknown Regions. A key concept for the Star Wars universe is the Force — the energy or field that binds all life in the galaxy . Many sentient beings know how to use the Force to gain magical-like abilities. The Force has a Light and a Dark side, around which many events of the saga revolve around their opposition. While the Light Side is about controlling one's emotions and channeling the Force to protect peace, the Dark Side is about following one's emotions, channeling the Force to achieve personal power. Traditionally, the Light Side is practiced by the Jedi, and the Dark Side by the Sith.The opening line in all Star Wars films is "A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...".
